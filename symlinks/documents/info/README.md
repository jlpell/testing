Symlink Test
============

This was a test to make sure that github can find a markdown
based README.md in a subdirectory of the project root, when
the readme is symlinked.

This is edit #2 for this file. I am checking to see if Github
is using symlinks properly.

This is edit #3 for this file. I am checking to see if Github
is using symlinks properly.

Obviously, github will not render a symlink based on the extension
of the symlink target.
